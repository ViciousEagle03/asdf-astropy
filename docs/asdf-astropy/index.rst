**************************

The **asdf-astropy** package contains code that is used to serialize ``astropy``
types so that they can be represented and stored using the Advanced Scientific
Data Format (ASDF).

If **asdf-astropy** is installed, no further configuration is required in order
to process ASDF files that contain **astropy** types. This is becuase both **asdf**
and **astropy** are required dependencies of **asdf-astropy**. Note that the **asdf**
package has be designed to automatically detect the presence of tags defined by
packages like **asdf-astropy** and automatically make use of that package's support
infrastructure to operate correctly.
